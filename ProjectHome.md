# PBSadmb #

The R package **PBSadmb** gives complete R support to the external program AD Model Builder (ADMB, http://admb-project.org/) released into the public domain in 2009. The program
offers users a remarkably efficient tool for estimating parameters and their uncertainty, based on complex nonlinear statistical models.

In a standard ADMB installation, users would interact with the program via a DOS command shell (in Windows) or a bash shell (in Linux or MacOS X). The package **PBSadmb** makes it possible to interact entirely from an R console, as a common interface for all operating systems. A single R script can encapsulate commands to ADMB, as well as all analyses that follow. The package includes protocols for writing code to make the integration between R and ADMB almost seamless.

**PBSadmb** also provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that facilitates the steps required for a complete ADMB analysis. Both new and experienced users can use the GUI for tutorial and educational purposes.

You can obtain **PBSadmb** from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN, http://cran.r-project.org/). Always use the current version of **PBSadmb** with the most recent version of **PBSmodelling**, another package available from CRAN. This web site, hosted by Google Code, features the **PBSadmb** User's Guide (`PBSadmb-UG.pdf`, also included with the package), as well as the current version of **PBSadmb**, which may be slightly more recent than that available on CRAN.

**PBSadmb** represents just one of a series of R packages developed at the Pacific Biological Station (PBS, http://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/facilities-installations/pbs-sbp/index-eng.htm). For futher information about the series, see http://code.google.com/p/pbs-software/.
