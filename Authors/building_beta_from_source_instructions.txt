Notes for building admb-10.0Beta2 for windows.

At the time of writing these instructions, the most current version is 10.0Beta2 which was released November 19, 2010
and downloaded from http://admb-project.org/downloads (direct link: http://admb-project.googlecode.com/files/admb-10.0Beta2.zip)

There are instructions for building the source provided at http://admb-project.org/documentation/installation/build; however, these notes attempt to fill in missing and incomplete steps.

For demonstration purposes, we will be working under the directory c:\admb_build; however, any directory may be used.

==Software required==

1. GnuWin32 Flex
2. mingw


===gnuwin32 Flex===
download the complete package ("Complete package, except sources") from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/flex.htm
(direct link: http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/gnuwin32/flex/2.5.4a-1/flex-2.5.4a-1.exe?r=http%3A%2F%2Fgnuwin32.sourceforge.net%2Fpackages%2Fflex.htm&ts=1294644043&use_mirror=superb-sea2 )
(size: 1226215, last change: 7 April 2004)

run flex-2.5.4a-1.exe
and choose the installation directory C:\admb_build\GnuWin32 (if you wish to directly follow this guide)
perform a "full installation"
no need to create start menu item
no need to download source files

the following files should now exist:
C:\admb_build\GnuWin32\bin\flex.exe
C:\admb_build\GnuWin32\bin\flex++.exe


===mingw===
download the latest version from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/
At the time, the downloaded version was: mingw-get-inst-20101030.exe (796.0 KB)

run mingw-get-inst-20101030.exe
use pre-packaged repository catalogues
install to C:\admb_build\MinGW
select components:
-"C Compiler"
-"C++ Compiler"


==unzip beta source==
unzip to C:\admb_build\admb-10.0Beta2
verify C:\admb_build\admb-10.0Beta2\src exists and contains the file mingw.mak

Open a cmd shell and cd to C:\admb_build\admb-10.0Beta2\src
and type:

set PATH=C:\admb_build\GnuWin32\bin;C:\admb_build\MinGW\bin;c:\Windows\system32

*this will allow cmd to find the installed software. Make sure system32 is also included as the makefile must be able to find cmd.exe

start the build process by typing:
mingw32-make --file=mingw.mak

TODO: need to try installing mingw-64 (http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/)
      might be distributed with the R tools; however, it's probably best to get it from the real source.
