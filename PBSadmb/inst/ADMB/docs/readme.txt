See "version.txt" in the \docs subdirectory for more information.

This program requires a user to install ADMB and a C/C++ compiler in 
suitable directories. Also a batch file "ADMcall.bat" needs to be 
changed to reflect these choices.

See "HowTo.txt" in \docs for detailed instructions on how to install the 
requisite software and make it work.
